\usage{
alias_matrix(
  design,
  midpoint = 0.5,
  intercept = FALSE,
  showplot = TRUE,
  symmetric = FALSE,
  digits = 3,
  palette = "viridis",
  alpha = 1,
  direction = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{Design of experiment (Without response)}

\item{midpoint}{A midpoint value between (0,1) to split the color scheme of three colors}

\item{intercept}{logical indicating to include the intercept coefficient. Default is FALSE}

\item{showplot}{logical indicating to show the correlation plot. If false, the correlation/alias matrix is returned. Default is TRUE}

\item{symmetric}{logical indicating to return all pairwise correlations between main effects and interaction effects. Default is FALSE}

\item{digits}{number of digits to round correlation values. Default is 3}

\item{palette}{A character string indicating the color map option to use. Eight options are available: "viridis","cividis","magma","inferno","plasma","rocket","mako","turbo"}

\item{alpha}{The alpha transparency, a number in [0,1]}

\item{direction}{Sets the order of colors in the scale. If 1, the default, colors are ordered from darkest to lightest. If -1, the order of colors is reversed}
}
\value{
correlation matrix between main effects and interaction effects from the model.matrix. Alias matrix is also returned
